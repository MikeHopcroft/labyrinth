# Labyrinth Architectural Concepts

General outline
* Convert rules to first-order logic on sets.
* Simplify expressions.
* Convert first-order logic back to rules.

## Encoding Rules

* [Disjunctive Normal form](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disjunctive_normal_form)
* Conjunction of sets on dimensions
* Dimensions are subsets of [min,max] ranges of integers

## Simplification Strategies

* Multiplicative Identity
* Multiply by Zero
* Additive Identity
* Add Domain
* [Quineâ€“McCluskey expression minimization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quine%E2%80%93McCluskey_algorithm)
